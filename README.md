# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver Using Genetic Algorithm

This repository offers a comprehensive solution for the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** by applying a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to efficiently optimize delivery routes. The objective is to assign delivery points to a fleet of vehicles, all starting and ending at a central depot, minimizing total travel distance while balancing workload across vehicles.

## Features

- **Multiple Vehicle Support:** Flexible configuration of the number of vehicles serving randomized delivery locations.
- **Randomized Delivery Points Generator:** Automated generation of delivery locations for simulation purposes.
- **Genetic Algorithm Framework (DEAP):**  
  - **Chromosome Representation:** Encodes complete routes for all vehicles.  
  - **Selection:** Tournament selection preserves high-quality solutions.  
  - **Crossover:** Ordered Crossover (OX) ensures feasible offspring routes.  
  - **Mutation:** Swap mutation promotes exploration and avoids local optima.  
- **Multi-Objective Fitness:** Optimizes for both total distance minimization and balanced distribution of deliveries.  
- **Visualization Tools:** Dynamic plotting of vehicle routes and performance progression via `matplotlib`.

## Repository Overview

- **Data Generation Module:** Scripts to generate and manage randomized delivery locations.  
- **VRP Core Logic:** Implements chromosome encoding, fitness evaluation, and genetic operators tailored to VRP.  
- **Visualization Module:** Functions to graphically present the best solutions across generations.  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** `vehicle_Routing_Algorithm.ipynb` integrates all components for interactive exploration and experimentation.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

```
pip install matplotlib deap
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:  
   `vehicle_Routing_Algorithm.ipynb`
2. Configure parameters before execution:  
   - `num_vehicles`: Number of delivery vehicles.  
   - `num_locations`: Number of delivery points.  
   - Genetic Algorithm parameters: `population_size`, `generations`, `cxpb` (crossover probability), `mutpb` (mutation probability).  
3. Run notebook cells sequentially to execute the GA.  
   - Monitor console outputs for best fitness progress.  
   - View evolving route visualizations updating in real-time.

## Output

- Console logs provide generation-by-generation feedback on the best solutions.  
- Graphical plots illustrate vehicle routes, facilitating visual assessment of route optimization quality.

## Applications

This VRP solver serves as both a benchmark for logistics optimization and an educational tool for studying evolutionary algorithms in practical scenarios. Adaptations and tuning may be required for specific operational environments or enterprise deployment.
